        During my studies at Universitas Klabat, I worked on several projects
        that strengthened my skills in both front-end and back-end development.
        I developed a mobile application using Visual Studio Code with
        TypeScript and Firebase as the backend, created a web application using
        Visual Studio with MySQL as the database, and built a responsive web
        application using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript integrated with
        Express.js, Prisma ORM, and PostgreSQL. These diverse projects provided
        me with comprehensive experience across different technology stacks and
        development environments.
