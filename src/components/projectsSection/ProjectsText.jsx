        During my studies at Universitas Klabat, I worked on several projects that strengthened my skills in both front-end and back-end development. 
        These included building a mobile attendance application using React Native and Firebase, developing a web-based student management system with PHP and MySQL, 
        and creating a task reminder app that focused on user experience and real-time notifications. 
        Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience in full-stack development, database integration, and UI/UX design.
